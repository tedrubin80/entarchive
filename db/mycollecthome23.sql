Burnett\'s variety show ran from 1967 to 1978 and produced 278 episodes, so this six-disc selection is only the tip of the iceberg. It\'s subtitled Carol\'s Favorites and features 16 episodes in full, lending a representative taste of the show\'s wacky vibe. Certain legendary sketches had to be included, including \"Went with the Wind,\" a send-up of Gone with the Wind that had Carol making one of the great walk-on sight gags in the history of television. Among the other movie parodies, a spoof of the Airport series of airborne disaster pictures is especially good at skewering the clichés of the genre.\n\nThe guest stars are a collection of \'70s TV faces: Dinah Shore, Roddy McDowall, Betty White, and Carol\'s favorites Jim Nabors and Ken Berry. A few are unexpected--Maggie Smith and Joanne Woodward, for instance--and there\'s a memorable appearance by the Jackson 5 during which a sketch is interrupted by a mild earthquake (the cameras keep running and Burnett ad-libs like a master). You\'ll also see some installments of \"The Family,\" the ongoing sketch that, at its best, walked an interesting line between hilarity and quiet (or loud) desperation. The time-capsule aspects that really date the show are the famously crazy costumes by Bob Mackie and the old-school variety-show musical numbers, some of which have a sincerity that was already unfashionable by 1974--although it should be noted that a musical spoof of \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" performed in Spanish by a supposed Mexican troupe, is a surreal exercise that predicts a later kind of conceptual comedy. Burnett\'s talents extend to her weekly improvs with the audience, and the comedy gold mined by Harvey Korman and Tim Conway remains glittering.\n\nThe extras include a good long (46 minutes!) interview with Korman and Conway riffing on each other; a couple of tributes/profiles of the show and Burnett that emphasize her status as a female comedy pioneer; a 35-minute cast reunion with Burnett, Conway, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner; brief (and randomly scattered) intros to certain episodes, with Burnett, Korman, and Conway; a full 33-minute episode of The Garry Moore Show, where Burnett came to prominence as a cast member; and other reminiscences.
