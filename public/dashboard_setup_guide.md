# 🚀 Personal Media Management System - Dashboard Setup Guide

## 📋 Current Status Summary

Based on your development notes, you have a comprehensive media management system with:

✅ **Working Components:**
- Enhanced dashboard with RSS feeds and Criterion Collection integration
- Authentication system (login/logout)
- Add item functionality with flexible categories
- Marketplace sync (eBay/Amazon integration)
- 2FA security framework
- Barcode scanner with QuaggaJS

⚠️ **Priority Issues to Address:**
- File permissions causing blank pages
- Missing user interface pages
- Scanner functionality verification
- Database connection stability

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup Process

### 1. **File Permissions Fix (CRITICAL)**

Run these commands in your project root to fix the most common blank page issues:

```bash
# Make directories writable by web server
chmod 755 cache/ logs/ uploads/ db/backups/

# Set proper file permissions
chmod 644 config/*.php public/*.php api/*.php

# Secure sensitive configuration
chmod 600 config/sensitive_config.php

# Fix .htaccess
chmod 644 .htaccess
```

### 2. **Run Diagnostic Scripts**

1. **Permissions Check:** Upload and run `permissions_check.php` in your root directory
2. **Dashboard Diagnostic:** Upload and run `dashboard_diagnostic.php` to test all components
3. **Missing Files Creator:** Upload and run `create_missing_files.php` to generate missing pages

### 3. **Verify Core Files**

Ensure these critical files exist and are working:

```
📁 Your Project Root/
├── 📄 config.php                           # Database configuration
├── 📁 public/
│   ├── 📄 enhanced_media_dashboard.php     # Main dashboard ✅
│   ├── 📄 user_login.php                   # Login page ✅
│   ├── 📄 user_add_item.php                # Add items ✅
│   └── 📄 user_scanner.php                 # Barcode scanner ⚠️
├── 📁 api/
│   └── 📄 api_integration_system.php       # API handling ✅
└── 📁 includes/
    └── 📄 inc_functions.php                # Core functions
```

### 4. **Database Setup**

If you haven't already, create your database structure:

1. Create MySQL database named `media_collection`
2. Update `config.php` with your database credentials
3. Run your existing database migrations
4. Test connection through the dashboard

### 5. **Test Your Dashboard Flow**

Follow this testing sequence:

1. **Login Test:** Visit `public/user_login.php`
   - Default credentials: `admin` / `password123`
   - Should redirect to enhanced dashboard

2. **Dashboard Test:** Visit `public/enhanced_media_dashboard.php`
   - Should show status indicators
   - RSS feed widget should load
   - Navigation links should work

3. **Add Item Test:** Click "Add Item" from dashboard
   - Form should load with flexible categories
   - API integrations should work

4. **Scanner Test:** Click "Scanner" from dashboard
   - Camera should activate (if permissions granted)
   - Manual barcode entry should work

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Blank Pages**
- **Cause:** File permissions or missing config.php
- **Fix:** Run permission commands above, check error logs

### **Database Errors**
- **Cause:** Wrong credentials or missing database
- **Fix:** Verify config.php settings, create database

### **Scanner Not Working**
- **Cause:** Missing QuaggaJS or camera permissions
- **Fix:** Check browser console, ensure HTTPS for camera access

### **Session Issues**
- **Cause:** PHP session configuration
- **Fix:** Check session.save_path, ensure writable session directory

- **Input sanitization** functions

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development server
php -S localhost:8000

# Test main pages
curl -I http://localhost:8000/public/user_login.php
curl -I http://localhost:8000/public/enhanced_media_dashboard.php

# Check error logs
tail -f logs/error.log

# Monitor access logs
tail -f logs/access.log
```

## 📞 Support Resources

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs:** `logs/error.log` and `logs/application.log`
2. **Run diagnostics:** Use the provided diagnostic scripts
3. **Verify permissions:** Ensure proper file/directory permissions
4. **Test components:** Use individual page tests from dashboard

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:

- ✅ Login redirects to dashboard without errors
- ✅ Dashboard shows collection statistics
